# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

Updating this code to HTML 5 semantics helped to improve SEO and general organization.  Each element of the code is easier to find and greater accessibility is achieved.  Writing code according to these semantics helps to solve issues with missing or multiple "divs" due to the sheer number used in previous HTML.  Learning the foundational elements of HTML 5 is an essential process for moving forward as a developer.
